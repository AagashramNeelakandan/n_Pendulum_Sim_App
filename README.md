# n_Pendulum_Sim_App

N Pendulums' Simulator for simulating more than double and triple pendulum setup

How many pendulums can your phone handle?

50, 100, 200 or even 1000? Check using the n_Pendulum Sim.
It can simulate any number of pendulums (as long as your phone supports them). 

n_Pendulum Sim solves the Lagrange equations of motions for the pendulums using the Adaptive step Runge Kutta Fehlberg method, which adaptively alters the time steps as per the pendulum motion. 

Also, behold the chaotic trails left by the pendulum in Rainbow colours.

Features:
•	Simulate 10, 100, 1000 pendulums or even more, pushing your devices limit.
•	Change various parameters like Number of pendulums, suspension length of pendulums', pendulums' mass, gravity, the initial angle of bobs, initial velocity and damping percentage. 
•	The default value is of 1 pendulum having a 1-metre length and 1 kg mass under the gravity of 9.81, suspended at 10 degrees at 0m/s with 100% damping (no resistance). No need for all the values to run the sim.
•	Stats to display current FPS along with the simulation time and current time step used by the Adaptive Runga Kyta method.
•	Trace toggles between showing traces in white and in rainbow colours. 
•	Drag to pan across the surface and use + & - buttons for Zooming in and out.
